### Project Description
The Ouija Board Web Game is an interactive, spooky-fun experience where users can ask questions and receive playful, ghostly responses. It combines traditional Ouija board mystique with lighthearted, funny replies, making it both eerie and entertaining!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are struggling to communicate with the spirit world in a safe, non-terrifying, and mildly ridiculous way. They need ghostly guidance without the inconvenience of actual supernatural encounters (or taking it too seriously!).

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the Ouija Board Web Game‚Äîa completely safe (and silly) portal to the other side! Now, users can consult a ‚Äúspirit‚Äù that‚Äôs as sarcastic as it is spooky, giving answers that range from wisecracks to half-hearted predictions. Whether you need advice on lunch or the meaning of life, this playful ghostly chatbot has you covered... sort of.
